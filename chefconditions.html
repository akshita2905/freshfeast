    <ol class="wcu-section-description pl-4">
        <li class="mb-2">
          All meals prepared by the chef must maintain high standards of cleanliness and hygiene.
          The kitchen space should be regularly sanitized and all cooking utensils and surfaces must be cleaned
          before and after every use to ensure customer safety.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          Only fresh, high-quality, and unexpired ingredients must be used for cooking.
          Meals prepared using stale, low-grade, or leftover ingredients will not be accepted and may result in deactivation from the platform.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          FreshFeast is strictly a home-cooked meal delivery platform. Pre-cooked meals, food from restaurants,
          or store-bought ready-to-eat items are strictly prohibited and considered a violation of platform policies.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          Chefs are required to update their daily availability status and menu offerings on the FreshFeast platform
          to maintain transparency and avoid customer dissatisfaction due to unavailable items.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          Timeliness is critical. All accepted meal orders must be prepared and ready for pickup at the scheduled time
          to ensure smooth coordination with delivery partners and satisfaction of customers.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          Before approval and listing on the platform, chefs must provide a valid government-issued ID and proof of residence.
          These documents will be securely stored for verification and compliance purposes.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          Each menu item must have a clear and honest description including ingredients, portion size, and pricing.
          Any significant changes to recipes or portions must be updated on the platform beforehand.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          Once a meal order is accepted by the chef, it cannot be canceled except in genuine emergency cases.
          In such situations, FreshFeast must be informed immediately so alternate arrangements can be made.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          Meals must be packed in clean, spill-proof, and food-safe packaging.
          Proper labeling with the item name and order details should also be followed to avoid confusion during delivery.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          The use of artificial food colors, synthetic preservatives, and artificial flavoring agents should be avoided.
          FreshFeast promotes healthy, homemade meals and expects chefs to maintain authenticity and nutrition.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          Chefs must maintain polite, professional, and respectful communication with both customers and FreshFeast team members.
          Any inappropriate behavior can lead to suspension from the platform.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          All transactions must be processed through FreshFeastâ€™s secure payment system.
          Chefs are not allowed to accept or request payments directly from customers in any form including cash, UPI, or bank transfers.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          If a dish contains common allergens like peanuts, dairy, soy, or gluten, it must be clearly indicated in the menu description
          to help customers with dietary restrictions make safe choices.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          FreshFeast may conduct random checks, including virtual or physical inspection of the kitchen space,
          to ensure consistent hygiene and quality standards.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          Any violation of the above terms may lead to warnings, temporary suspension, or permanent removal from the FreshFeast platform.
          FreshFeast reserves the right to take appropriate action based on the severity of the issue.
